`Game-Logic`

Every player gets a chance to roll the dice. He or she can roll the die, and if the number is not 1, the dice number will continue to add to the score. After each roll, the player has the option of keeping the score or losing it. Because If the dice rolls 1, then chance will go to the other player. But if the player decides to hold on to the score, in that case, chance will go to player 2. Your score remains the same.
